# promote-feature-flag-to-stable

## Description
Promote the domain's feature flag from `beta/state=0` to `stable/state=1` in a dedicated GA PR. This is the only change in the GA PR — no features, no other file changes.

## Context
- **Brick:** R1 — Step 12
- **Reads from:** H3 (flag entry to edit), E3–E7 (all playwright campaigns must pass before this)
- **Writes to:** R3 (Playwright tests updated after this), R2 (upgrade SQL if needed)
- **Artifact:** `install-dev/data/xml/feature_flag.xml` (edit H3 output)
- **PS example:** Search `feature_flag.xml` for `<stability>stable</stability>` entries to see the pattern

## Instructions

1. Verify GA prerequisites before opening PR (see step-12-general-availability.md checklist).
2. Open `install-dev/data/xml/feature_flag.xml`.
3. Find `<feature_flag id="{domain}">`.
4. Change `<stability>beta</stability>` to `<stability>stable</stability>`.
5. Change `<state>0</state>` to `<state>1</state>`.
6. Save — these are the ONLY changes in this PR.
7. After merging: manually verify the flag is `stable/state=1` in a fresh install.

## Rules

- GA PR contains ONLY the flag promotion — zero feature changes
- Do not change any other flag entry in this file
- Promote in a dedicated PR so it can be reverted instantly if a critical bug is found
- `stability=stable` + `state=1` together: stable means "shown as stable in admin panel", state=1 means "enabled by default"
